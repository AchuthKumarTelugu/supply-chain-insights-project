# 📦 AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Dashboard – Power BI Project

This is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard project that analyzes service level KPIs for **AtliQ Mart**, a growing FMCG manufacturer. The dashboard tracks and improves delivery performance metrics like **On-Time**, **In-Full**, **OTIF**, **LIFR**, and **VOFR**, enabling faster business decisions and helping prevent customer churn.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart observed that several key customers didn’t renew their contracts, likely due to poor service levels such as delayed or incomplete deliveries. As the company plans to expand to Tier 1 cities, the management tasked the analytics team with tracking delivery KPIs and uncovering service-level failures.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor **OT %, IF %, and OTIF %** across cities and customers
- Identify gaps in **line item accuracy (LIFR)** and **volume delivery (VOFR)**
- Pinpoint **at-risk customers** and suggest operational fixes
- Enable **root cause analysis** using visuals like heatmaps, ribbons, sparklines

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- 📊 Power BI (Data modeling, DAX, visualization)
- 📁 CSV files, structured in star schema
- 🔁 Data relationships using fact and dimension tables

## 🔍 Key Visuals & Insights

### 1. Service Level Heatmap by Customer



- Identifies customers with OTIF < 30%
- Highlights high-risk clients like **Rel Fresh** and **Propel Mart**
- Uses conditional formatting for quick visual alerts

---

### 2. LIFR & VOFR Trends with Ribbon Charts



- LIFR remains ~65%, showing frequent partial deliveries
- VOFR stays above 96%, but doesn’t reflect true service quality
- Ribbon charts reveal monthly trends by city and category

---

### 3. Delay Analysis & Lead Time



- Over 25% of orders were delayed by 1–3 days
- Early deliveries also observed, indicating scheduling issues
- Breakdown by city and category

---

## 📉 Business Impact

- OTIF is only **~29%** against a target of 65%
- High churn risk from top customers due to poor fulfillment
- VOFR gives a false positive — actual delivery quality is low
- Operational delays consistent across cities (especially **Vadodara**)

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Prioritize **LIFR and OTIF** over VOFR in service reporting
- Implement **warehouse-level quality checks** for complete item dispatch
- Flag at-risk customers and launch retention recovery steps
- Use **alerts** in Power BI for low KPI thresholds

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Advanced DAX (dynamic measures, KPI comparisons)
- Power BI UI/UX design (custom slicers, sparklines, ribbons)
- Root cause analysis & business storytelling
- Data modeling with star schema (fact and dimension tables)
